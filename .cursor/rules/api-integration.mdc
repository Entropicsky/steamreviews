# API Integration Guidelines

## Steam API Integration
- Use the public endpoint: `https://store.steampowered.com/appreviews/{appid}`
- Always include appropriate headers including User-Agent
- Implement rate limiting (1 second between requests)
- Handle pagination via cursor mechanism
- Cache responses to avoid redundant API calls
- Support language filtering (especially for Chinese: 'schinese' and 'tchinese')

## OpenAI API Integration
- Store API keys in `.env` file (never commit API keys)
- Use the modern OpenAI client library
- Use the Responses API for translations and analysis
- Implement retry logic for API failures
- Cache translations to minimize API costs
- Set appropriate context in prompts for better results
- Use system and user messages correctly in the Responses API

## General API Guidelines
- Implement error handling for all API calls
- Log API responses at appropriate logging levels
- Set reasonable timeouts for all requests
- Use dataclasses or models to structure API responses
- Implement proper exception handling for network issues
