# Agent Notes

## Project: Steam Reviews Analysis Tool

### Project Overview
This tool will analyze Steam reviews for games, with a special focus on translating Chinese reviews to English using the OpenAI Responses API and gpt-4.1 model.

### Project Status
- Project reset for methodical approach
- Documentation and planning updated
- Prototype script development in progress

### Development Approach
- Two-phase development:
  1. Simple prototype script focused on specific app ID (3228590)
  2. Full application with UI and expanded features
- Starting with command-line prototype to validate core functionality
- Using provided Steam API code as starting point

### Documentation Structure
- Project checklist: `.cursor/notes/project_checklist.md`
- Development notebook: `.cursor/notes/notebook.md`
- Technical specification: `.cursor/docs/steam_reviews_tech_spec.md`
- API documentation: `.cursor/docs/OAIResponsesAPI.md` and `.cursor/docs/openaidocs.md`

### Project Dependencies
- OpenAI Python SDK (latest version for Responses API support)
- Python dotenv for environment variables
- Requests for API calls
- JSON/CSV processing
- Later: Streamlit or Flask, PDF/Excel generation libraries

### User Preferences
- Focus on Chinese to English translation of reviews
- Initial focus on app ID 3228590
- Later enable configuration for different games and parameters
- Output in readable format, eventually PDF and Excel options

### Important Technical Notes
- Using OpenAI's Responses API (not the older Chat Completions API)
- Using gpt-4.1 model with larger context window
- Configure via environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4.1")
- Steam API pagination handled via cursor parameter
- Need to implement proper rate limiting

### Important Reminders
- Check documentation regularly
- Update project checklist as progress is made
- Document technical decisions in the notebook
- Maintain modular approach for easy extension
