# Development Notebook

### Project Reset and Refocus
- Project approach has been reset to take a more methodical, step-by-step approach
- Focus shifted to using OpenAI's Responses API and the newer gpt-4.1 model
- Initial goal: Create a simple prototype script before building full application

### Research Notes
- OpenAI's Responses API replaces the older Chat Completions API
  - Documentation in `.cursor/docs/OAIResponsesAPI.md` and `.cursor/docs/openaidocs.md`
  - Offers improved capabilities over previous APIs
  - Requires slightly different implementation approach
- gpt-4.1 model offers larger context window compared to previous models
  - Will enable better analysis of large batches of reviews
  - Should provide higher quality translations
- Steam API access using format: `https://store.steampowered.com/appreviews/{appid}`
  - Can filter by language, review type, etc.
  - Need to handle pagination via cursor parameter
  - Requires rate limiting (1 second between requests recommended)

### Technical Considerations
- OpenAI configuration via environment variables:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY defined in .env file
  - OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4.1" defined in .env file
- Starting with specific target:
  - App ID: 3228590
  - 200 Chinese reviews
  - Later will expand to configurable parameters
- Output formats to consider:
  - PDF report with translations and summaries
  - Excel export with raw data
  - Simple web UI (Streamlit or Flask)

### Development Plan
- Start with simple prototype script
  - Focus on core functionality (fetch, translate, summarize)
  - No UI for initial prototype
- Use the prototype to validate approach and identify challenges
- Refine into modular application with proper architecture
- Add UI and export functionality

### Next Steps
- Implement prototype script using provided Steam API example code
- Set up OpenAI client with Responses API
- Test translation capabilities with batch processing
- Develop summary prompts for gpt-4.1 model
- Validate approach before proceeding to full application
